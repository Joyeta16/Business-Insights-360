## Company Overview  

AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly growing electronics company specializing in hardware products, including PC accessories, printers, and more. Over the years, AtliQ has expanded significantly, establishing a strong global presence in key regions such as APAC, North America, Latin America, and the European Union.

The company distributes its products through two primary sales platforms:
- Brick-and-Mortar Stores – Partnering with physical retail outlets like Croma and Best Buy.
- E-Commerce Platforms – Selling through online giants like Amazon and Flipkart.

Moreover, AtliQ operates through multiple sales channels:
- Retailers – Third-party sellers, both online and offline, that stock and sell AtliQ’s products.
- Direct Stores – AtliQ’s own branded stores, where consumers can purchase directly.
- Distributors – In restricted markets like China and South Korea, AtliQ collaborates with large distributors to ensure product availability.

**Note:** AtliQ’s customers are retailers and distributors, while the consumers are the end users.

## Problem Statement

As a rapidly growing company, AtliQ Hardware's reliance on scattered Excel sheets for analytics has led to inefficient decision-making, resulting in significant losses, particularly during its Latin American expansion. Meanwhile, competitors leveraging advanced data analytics have gained an edge, leaving AtliQ struggling to keep up with outdated methods. To improve transparency in data-driven decisions and stay competitive, AtliQ has launched a data analytics project to enhance decision-making and strategic growth.

## Project Objective

To develop an intuitive dashboard that delivers actionable insights for finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams, along with an executive and key performers view. This will enhance transparency, improve data accessibility, and empower stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions for strategic growth and efficiency.

## Data Overview

AtliQ has provided two SQL databases (gdb041 and gdb056) containing dimension (descriptive data) and fact (transactional data) tables. Additionally, three Excel files were shared: Operating Expenses, Targets (available only for FY 2022), and Market Share (limited to the Personal Computer division). AtliQ’s fiscal year runs from September to August, and the dataset covers actual sales from September 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. Since this is a bootcamp project, the data files cannot be shared.

The two databases are as follows:

gdb041: Contains fact tables (fact_trips, fact_passenger_summary) and dimension tables (dim_date, dim_city, dim_repeat_trip_distribution).
gdb056: Contains city- and month-specific target tables (monthly_target_trips, monthly_target_new_passengers, city_target_passenger_rating).
